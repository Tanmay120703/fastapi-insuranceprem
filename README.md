# ðŸ’¼ Insurance Premium Category Prediction API

This FastAPI-based project predicts the **insurance premium category** of a user based on demographic and lifestyle details such as age, BMI, income, occupation, smoking habits, and city tier.

The API uses a pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`) to return the predicted insurance premium **category**.
